This file serves as a means to keep track of a Colorado School of Mines Project. The concept of this design is to use a raspberry pi and arduino uno together to detect an aruco marker by spinning a robot 360 degrees and adjusting to the angle at which the aruco marker as at. From there the robot will move towards the aruco and stop within a foot of the marker and spin 180 degrees around the marker without knocking it down.
